          <section class="content"><p>I’m Sophie from Whidbey Island in Washington State and I like to pretend I know what’s cool. My music taste is pretty broad so I won’t go into detail, but I will say I like Dave Matthews Band in a very un-ironic way. Here’s what to listen to while smoking, painting nails, and driving home at 5&nbsp;<span class="caps">AM</span>.</p>
<p><span class="more"></p>
<pre><code>Artist: Autre Ne Veut
Song: Counting
Album: Anxiety
Label: Mexican Summer
</code></pre><p>“Counting,” by Brooklyn producer Arthur Ashin (his name only revealed to fans recently, as to protect his identity during his studies in psychology for his masters degree), easily stands out as the most powerful track off of Autre Ne Veut’s February 2013 album Anxiety. Ashin’s delicate falsetto sets him apart from the sea of “bedroom R&amp;B” producers, as well as his use of honking horn section squeaks and heavy groans that make up the underlying beat of “Counting”; so deep they feel almost pelvic. “Counting” is about ends—in particular, the death of Ashin’s grandmother. The falsetto cries out that <code>I’m counting on the idea that you’ll stay alive</code> and now you understand the pain behind the lyrics, as well as the catharsis behind the anguish turned into soaring vocals and electronic trills. <code>This is not your time to make it out</code> screams Ashin, imploring vitality to continue in this relationship, in this life, in this&nbsp;season.</p>
<pre><code>Artist: Dum Dum Girls
Song: There Is A Light That Never Goes Out
Album: He Gets Me High EP
Label: Sub Pop
</code></pre><p>I will refrain from claiming to like this cover of The Smiths’ joyful lamentation better than the original, but it definitely comes close. Leading lady Kristen “Dee Dee” Gundred’s voice is expansive and elastic. The solid strumming of the guitars are unbound and grinding. Gundred’s cover is almost more emotional than the never-outdone Morrissey. I can sense a bit of anger within her soft growl, but when it’s time for the chorus, the famous <code>And if a ten ton truck kills the both of us // to die by your side well the pleasure, the privilege is mine</code>, the sentiment is soft and lovely, and infuses the melody with the utmost beauty. The guitars concede to the poetry of the song itself and to the vocals of the Dum Dum Girls, which have been uttered with a quite angelic element. The juxtaposition of these sweet female voices with Morrissey’s raw songwriting makes this my song choice for my <span class="caps">MP3</span> player whilst passing my college crush on the way across the quad as a way to feel powerful again under their&nbsp;gaze.</p>
<pre><code>Artist: Ghost Loft
Song: Seconds
Album: Seconds
</code></pre><p><code>Be there in seconds flat // Just tell me where you at// Everywhere you want to go// I’ve been there before// That means he don&#39;t need to know</code> These are the opening lines of “Seconds,” by Danny Choi, <span class="caps">AKA</span> LA producer Ghost Loft, who has created the ultimate track of nighttime secrecy. The tune itself is straightforward, but it seems to float into the night before the beat comes in. It is steady, and not quite sure of itself, but it evokes the feeling of urban anxiety; essentially fearful and extremely tentative. But the song feels like a journey, possibly to the doorstep of a lover. “Seconds” is dark, yet comforting with the presence of the quiet voice of track, who appeals to the delicacy and urgency of the actions made in the dead of the&nbsp;night.</p>
<pre><code>Artist: J. Tillman
Song: Earthly Bodies
Album: Year in the Kingdom
Label: Western Vinyl
</code></pre><p>I could tell you about how I feel about fall: the severing of ties, the loss, the renewal, the journey into the darkness in order to grow and evolve… but I’m sure you’ve discovered what autumn means for yourself, or have read about it in some article about re-organizing your life in time for winter. Anyway, I first heard “Earthly Bodies” in an airport bathroom while taking my significant other to his flight back to England. Knowing I would not see him for a long time I was clearly a mess. I was wiping my eyes in the mirror and heard <code>Let me lay across your crescent spine // Press my belly to the mountainside</code>. I conjured up the road trip I had just taken with my love: the lazy day by the river in the middle of the still-snow-capped mountains amid the shade of green only seen in the Northwest. I got home a few hours later and thought about starting over at college soon and about the autumn of the Northeast. “Earthly Bodies” played as I fell asleep dreaming about the cold weather and healing my hurting heart. Four months later, as I sit in my dorm room that over looks the burgundy-colored quad, J. Tillman’s ballad to transformation, love lost and found in the pleasure of connections to people and nature, and finding comfort within another person still plays. The fall season continues to change me through music, walks in the forest in the glory of Massachusetts, and nostalgia of summer memories with my boyfriend. <code>Baby, lay your head where we begin and end</code> Tillman sings, asking us through his soft-spoken, wondering-at-the-world poetry that we remember fall is both the end and the start of the cycle of holding on and letting&nbsp;go.</p>
