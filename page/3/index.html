          <section class="content"><p>For the few years I was discovering new music on my own, I would play the most recent album on Rdio to see if I liked a band. In 2011, Spoon’s latest was the divisive <em>Transference</em>. It’s still one of my favorite Spoon albums, and I was never a huge fan of <em><span class="caps">GA</span> GA GA GA GA</em> or <em>Gimme Fiction</em> (both enjoyable listens, but neither stood out to me). It took me another few years to discover the breakthrough <em>Kill the Moonlight</em>, which remains my favorite Spoon album. <em>They Want My Soul</em>, however, is the now-mature band’s best offering since their&nbsp;career-standout.</p>
