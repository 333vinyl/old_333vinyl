          <section class="content"><p>My name is Mason Lynaugh and I will occasionally be contributing to 333vinyl. My musical tastes include Ben’s, but are more concerned with the most recent developments in hip hop - whether it be drill, coastal, trap, or slip-hop - so I will focus mainly on what has been blaring through my speakers on its path to being overplayed. I’m planning on doing periodical entries under the terrible title “if we hung out” because “songs I would make you listen to if we hung out” was a bit worse, and the people who do hang out with me would attest to its&nbsp;accuracy.</p>

          <section class="content"><p><em>Transatlanticism</em> is widely considered Death Cab For Cutie’s magnum opus. It’s Death Cab’s fourth studio album of seven, but probably the first album that comes to someone’s mind when they talk about the band. “Sound of Settling,” which frontman Ben Gibbard originally didn’t want to include on the album, has become one of Death Cab’s biggest hits. The rough concept album about distance and its effect on relationships is beloved by critics, teenagers, and music enthusiasts alike, and is considered an instant&nbsp;classic.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>It took me a few listens to get into <em>You Forgot It In People</em>. The first time I downloaded it, I skimmed through the songs. Upon not finding any immediate hits on what was billed as a pop album, I decided to give it a more thorough listen on a later date. Now, nearly a year after first listening to it, I decided to give it another chance, and another, and another. There is so much more to this album than I initially&nbsp;thought.</p>

          <section class="content"><p><em>The Modern Lovers</em> starts off with Richman counting <code>1-2-3-4-5-6!</code>, a twist on the classic four-count that begins so many songs. It’s a little familiar, a little odd, and strangely endearing, all threads that run deep in the band’s definitive proto-punk opus as well as in the work of the countless artists that were inspired by the&nbsp;album.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>Le Tigre is perhaps best known as Kathleen Hanna’s other band. Hanna was the frontwoman of Bikini Kill (which kickstarted the riot grrrl movement), has had several documentaries made about her, and (fun-fact) is married to Ad-Rock. But I only heard about Le Tigre yesterday while looking for dance-punk bands. I had no idea Hanna was involved until the first verse of the first (and perhaps best) song, “Deceptacon,” which tears down preconceptions, sets expectations, and takes a shot at pop music in five lines: <code>Wanna disco? / Wanna see me disco? / Let me hear you depoliticize my rhyme. / One! Two! Three! Four! /  You got what you been asking for.</code> It’s a classic Hanna takedown, one which sets the tone nicely for the rest of <em>Le Tigre</em>.</p>
